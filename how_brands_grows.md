## Chapter 1&2 Evidence based Marketing, How do brands grow
1. Many things that we’ve been told are important, such as loyalty programs, are not, many facts marketing ppl believe, particularly about brand buying, are incorrect.
2. Loyalty metrics for competing brands are actually quite similar
-- Double Jeopardy law: brands grow primarily by increasing their market penetration, rather than increasing frequency. With few exceptions, the lower-market-share brands in a market have both far fewer buyers in a time period and also lower brand loyalty, you can’t have significant growth by growing loyalty alone.
-- Introducing new uses of a product as a strategy to grow is extremely difficult as it’s hard to change ppl’s habits, and it’s hard to build non-obvious mental structures, and few brands have the budget to change how the population thinks about a product category.
-- Campaigns targeting acquiring new customers are way more effective than those targeting existing customers
Niche is not necessarily a good thing
-- Cross selling sounds suspicious, it’s not impossible but it is very hard.
-- A common fallacy is that customers who stay longer or have purchased several can generate more profits.
