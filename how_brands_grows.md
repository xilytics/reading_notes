## Chapter 1&2 Evidence based Marketing, How do brands grow
1. Many things that we’ve been told are important, such as loyalty programs, are not, many facts marketing ppl believe, particularly about brand buying, are incorrect.
2. Loyalty metrics for competing brands are actually quite similar:
   1. Double Jeopardy law: brands grow primarily by increasing their **market penetration**, rather than increasing purchasing frequency. With few exceptions, the lower-market-share brands in a market have both far fewer buyers in a time period and also lower brand loyalty, you can’t have significant growth by growing loyalty alone.
   2. Introducing new uses of a product as a strategy to grow is extremely difficult as it’s hard to change ppl’s habits, and it’s hard to build non-obvious mental structures, and few brands have the budget to change how the population thinks about a product category.
   3. Campaigns targeting acquiring new customers are way more effective than those targeting existing customers
   4. Niche is not necessarily a good thing
   5. Cross selling sounds suspicious, it’s not impossible but it is very hard.
   6. A common fallacy is to believe that customers who stay longer or have purchased several can generate more profits.

## Chapter 3 How to grow your customer base
1. The research that claimed retention could be cheaper than acquisition is based on a thought experiment and lacks empirical evidence.
2. Brands with a larger market share have slightly lower defection levels (i.e. higher loyalty).
3. Aiming to increase loyalty via investments in customer relationship management and other customer satisfaction initiatives is seldom cheap or easy.
4. Potential gains from acquisition dwarf the potential gains from reducing defection.
5. Acquisition is key and necessary, even the biggest brands would lose customers due to reasons they can’t control and it’s essentially difficult to literally nurture ‘loyalty’ and to reduce defection.

## Chapter 4 Which customers matter most
1. Mass marketing is not dying, it’s just the marketers need to be better at it.
2. Pareto law
   1.It’s law like and applies across brands and categories, but
   2.It’s not as severe as 80/20
   3.The analytical time period affects Pareto metrics and messes up attempts to target based on customer value - the law of buyer moderation - next period your heaviest 20% of customers won’t be so heavy and the light buyers will be heavier
   4.It’s not healthy to only want to or plan to just recruit heavy-buying buyers
3. For maintenance or growth, a brand’s marketing has to gain a bit more heavy buyers, get more medium buyers and a lot more light buyers – which means that it has to somehow at least over time, reach all the buyers in a category
4. Targeting a certain segment of buyers would not bring decent sales growth, this is a misguided fantasy - Marketing has the best chance of being successful when it has as much reach as possible, it’s most successful when it reaches light and non-buyers of a brand.

## Chapter 5 Our buyers are different
1. In fact, the more market share they gain, the more normal their customer base becomes.
2. Customer bases of brands in a category are very similar, except in numbers of buyers.
3. When market research tells us that our brands skew towards a certain group, what we should do is not to target young women in the media, instead, what we should be asking is (is there something wrong with our marketing that we are failing to reach some demographics?
4. The author thinks it’s wrong to assume a brand appeals to a particular type of buyers, most don’t and they shouldn’t want to? A brand sells to an *unusual customer profile* because it’s 
currently marketed that way or because of history or mistakes. It doesn’t mean that it’d sell best.
5. There is nothing structural standing in the way of your brand growing.

*Summary*: The author believes that it’s wrong to think that as a type of product you are targeting different types/segments, the customers currently look skewed potentially due to that the brand has been marked that way.
If the segments get really clear then the marketing department would need to go home and the ultimate goal to grow commercially is to be able to be used by wider audiences

## Chapter 6 Who do you really compete with
1. The problem of produce specified products tailored for certain ppl and having strategies to reach them by certain channels have problems
2. Simply naming a segment doesn’t make it exist, we need empirical evidence and data to substantiate the claims
3. Direct competitors within a product category should show higher levels of sharing customers
4. Duplication of purchase analysis - to analyze share of customers, the analyst should choose a period long enough to capture a degree of repeated purchase, a period long enough to allow most ppl to buy multiple brands, it’s good to describe an overlap of customers together with a frequency, e.g. ‘70% of pepsi buyers drink coke in a year’
5. The duplication of purchase law: all brands, within a category, share customers with the most popular brands and share a smaller part with smaller brands


## Chapter 7 Passionate customer commitment
1. No brand should expect its buyers to  be 100% loyal
2. To grow a brand needs to recruit more light category buyers
3. To not only sell, but also make a brand ‘loveable’ is dangerously difficult
4. The obsession with ‘brand love’ in marketing and academic, is quite fake, deemed the author.
5. Loyalty is rarely exclusive, it’s more accessible, routined, or more like a habit.
6. Our brand memories, brand buying are probabilistic, whether or not we recall a belief is highly dependent on the situation, and is very much affected by the cues that are used to elicit the belief
7. Attitudinal commitment to brands is much weaker than marketing mythology makes out
8. Very few customers both regularly buy from the category but also stay very loyal to one brand.
(The author would like to argue the effect of brand fanatics is really trivial, to support the argument the author used repeat rates among computer brands from 2002 and supplement with surveys conducted with 3 different panels.


*Summary*: Within every brand’s customer base there are a few people who feel much more attitudinally committed to the brand. It may be part of their self-image, used to signal what sort of person they are to themselves and to others. But the marketing consequences of these brand fan(atic)s turn out to be very limited. 
Most of a brand’s customers think and care little about the brand, but the brand manager should care about these people because they represent most of the brand’s sales; the brand needs these people if it is to increase its sales.

## Chapter 8 Differentiation versus distinctiveness
1. Bigger brands will likely to score higher in survey data regarding brand perception
2. This doesn’t mean market research is useless, but rather they help the marketers to ensure that all their advertising is truly branded - to look like you, know how that the market already sees you and so on.
3. Brand personality is also very vague and hard to have empirical meanings.
4. A brand is more likely to be perceived as the only brand with a particular quality if it has few competitors.
5. USP is usually a strong belief but it can be greatly challenged because the author argue that advertising can work effectively without a USP or a means of persuasion.
6. Buyers of a brand perceive very weak differentiation, but this wouldn’t stop them loyally buying that brand.
7. A brand’s level of perceived differentiation is very similar to their rivals.
8. Brands are different from one other, and they are perceived as such, but differentiation plays a small role in how brands compete.
9. Brands with low perceived differentiation still can grow v continuously and long term.
10. The fundamental purpose of branding is to identify the source of the product or service, rather than differentiation by utilizing distinctive assets. Elements could be : colors, logos, taglines, symbols, celebrities, advertising styles
11. To build brand, we must ensure a consistency in visual / style elements across media and campaign
12. Branding’s core should be finding and building *distinctive assets* which let ppl know and identify them easier rather than trying to find unique selling propositions or build different perceptions.
marketing should build distinctive qualities that increase the visibility of the brand in its competitive environment price (i.e. branding matters). Distinctive assets make it easier for consumers to notice, recognise, recall and (importantly) buy the brand. An emphasis on distinctiveness means less of trying to find unique selling propositions and more trying to find unique identifying characteristics. Distinctive assets are not what motivate consumers to buy brands; it’s how they know where the brand is and what brand they bought. They allow for the development of loyalty

## Chapter 9 How advertising really works
1. Advertising causes sales even if a brand’s sale figures are flat as competitors can steel customers easily by using their advertisement
2. Movements in this week’s or month’s sales figures don’t reveal the full sales impact of advertising
3. A little bit of your advertising today works today, but much is to prevent people from being less likely to buy you when they make their next category purchase in months/years time
Put simply, the entire sales effect of a price promotion shows up in a week’s sales figures, while the sales effect of advertising is spread very thinly into the future; this makes changes in advertising weight very difficult to see and extraordinarily hard to measure/model reliably.
4. Successful advertising, in particular, reaches the millions of consumers who have a very low probability of buying a brand next week or month. 
t advertising works through its effect on memories
5. An advertisement cannot build memory structures if it is not processed; memory structures cannot generate sales if they are not associated with the brand that is being advertised. (attention and memory) - emotion is key
SIngle source data??
6. Persuasive advertising are more powerful if they include explicit emotional appeals
Most ppl are inherently cynical about truth in ad and that they automatically discount claims about quality made in ad that cannot be objectively assessed.


**A recipe for effective advertising is:
- Reach all the category buyers
- Don’t have lapses in ad
- Get noticed, not screened out
- Use clear brand links (A brand’s distinctive assets, mentioning the brand name, showing the product and showing the product in use
- Refresh and build memory structures that make a brand more likely to come to mind and be easier to notice
- If there is a piece of information that is genuinely persuasive then say it, so long as it does not interfere with achieving the previous objectives.**

## Chapter 10 What price promotions really do
1. Consumers do not confine themselves into 1 price category, so it’s hard to successfully target an exclusively low price buyer segment with price promotions, because such a segment doesn’t exist
2. Price promotions are popular with managers because the results are easy to see. This could be more than addictive to marketers.
3. Price promotions don’t win new customers. 
4. Price promotion pulls in a large proportion of infrequent buyers. They bought during the promotion and then afterwards resume their low buying propensity.


## Chapter 11 Why loyalty programs often don't work
One of the problems with large-scale consumer loyalty programs is that they are difficult for firms to exit from them

## Chapter 12 Mental and Physical Availability
1. One of the problems with large-scale consumer loyalty programs is that they are difficult for firms to exit from them
2. Being noticed and considered is often the biggest factor in why a brand is bought or not
3. Evaluation is therefore less important and less predictable than our market research techniques assume
4. So the big marketing issue is how to get a brand thought of, more often, in more buying situations; in other words, how to build mental availability.
5. Therefore, building mental availability is about developing **different memory links** (that relate to a brand) to increase the scope of the brand-related network in people’s memories – the brand’s share of mind.
6. When a brand scores well on traditional awareness measures but its sales are disappointing, the common conclusion is that buyers don’t like the brand. However, the problem can be that, **while buyers know of the brand (and find it acceptable), they seldom think of it or notice it when they are in buying situations**.
7. So it is necessary for marketers to have a broad understanding of the **thought processes** that consumers go through before they even think of any brands as options to buy
These assets can be sold, and they are generally worth far more than a corporation’s tangible assets. Mental and physical availability, and the brand’s distinctive iconography (discussed in Chapter 8) are assets that can be sold. They are brand equity.
8. Just because some consumers see you as having a particular little difference (e.g. friendlier staff, purpose, ethical stance) doesn’t mean that this is your path to success. Differentiation just doesn’t matter that much.
Rules of mental and physical availability
9. Continuously reach all buyers of the brand’s service/product category, with both physical distribution and marketing communication. 
Ensure the brand is easy to buy. 
10. Get noticed. Often. 
11. Refresh and build brand-linked memory structures that make the brand **easier to notice and buy**. 
Create distinctive communication assets. 
12. Be consistent, yet fresh and interesting. 
13. Stay competitive, keep up the mass appeal; don’t give customers reasons not to buy the brand.
