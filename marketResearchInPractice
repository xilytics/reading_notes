Jotting down some important key takeaways which inspire and support one to do professional market research.

### Chapter 09-10 Quantitative research; Sampling and Statstistics
- We are moving into the quantitative territory with a sample size greater than 30 in each cell.
- Size of sample;. It is the absolute size of the sample that determines accuracy, not the proportion that the sample represents of the total population
- Random sampling in consumer markets
  Quadrupling the sample will usually double the accuracy for a given sample design. For example, if we interviewed 500 people, the error on a question would be plus or minus 2.7%, but if we interview 2000, then it will be + or - 1.3%
  They must always be judged in terms of their accuracy on the number in the group of people being examined, a minimum size for a sub-cell in a quantitative survey is around 50 ppl.
- If the ranges of error do not overlap between two results of two sub-groups, then we can say the difference is statistically significant, that sub-group 1 is significantly different with sub-group2 with regards a question
- Quota samples
  Remember to check quality/reputation of online panels.
  Previous survey and census data tell us the splits by gender, age, income, geography, and many other key selection criteria.
  Filling the quota will provide a mix of respondents that is reflective of the population being targeted.
  If numbers required within a subgroup is sufficient to meet the needs of the total sample size but too small to provide reliable results about a subgroup, the common solution is to over sample the subgroup

### Chapter 11 Questionnaire design
- Behavior questions
  Aiming at find out what do ppl claim to do.
  They are often more robust and believable than answers to attitudinal questions.
  Behavioural economics: decisions are not necessarily made on logic alone but on heuristics.
- Attitudinal questions
  Scales are commonly used to measure attitudes:
    Numerical rating
    Verbal rating (Questions like how likely can not necessarily be trusted, ppl’s claim in market research is very different from a real buying situation
    Semantic differential scales (Usually used to find out ppl’s emotional attachments to brands)
    Ranking (6 factors in the list is about the maximum, usually would ask about top5)
- Classification questions
  Demographic, socioeconomic, etc. For specific market, they might have a universal socioeconomic grades to use, for example in the UK
- Three steps in questionnaire design
  Formulating the questions: have objectives, is it for brand positioning, satisfaction or more? Listing some points, include classification questions that will be useful for slicing and dicing the data. A reasonable maximum of questionnaire takes about 15-20 minutes with 30-40 questions
    Ensure questions are without bias
    Make the questions simple
    Make the questions very specific (No very often, quite often, every now and then, things like this that’s impossible to identify)
    Avoid jargon
    Avoid questions with a negative in them
    Do not ask questions that are outside of reference of the respondents (Better to ask how many litres of milk do you buy in a typical week instead of how much do you buy each year)
    Avoid too many rating scales
  Arranging layout
    Use screener questions to include only relevant ppl
    Open questions are usually put before closed ones, but the reasoning one often come after closed ones
  Piloting and testing the draft questionnaire
- Special questionnaires: Conjoint analysis/Concept test
    We group product attributes in different ways and see how respondents would pick.
    Need at least 100, and best if can reach more than 200
    Choiced based
    MaxDiff, several rounds of asking for which is the most important to least important factors 
- Trade off grids (need to know more)  
  Easier than Conjoint analysis
