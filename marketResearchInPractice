Jotting down some important key takeaways which inspire and support one to do professional market research.

### Chapter 09-10 Quantitative research; Sampling and Statstistics
- We are moving into the quantitative territory with a sample size greater than 30 in each cell.
- Size of sample;. It is the absolute size of the sample that determines accuracy, not the proportion that the sample represents of the total population
- Random sampling in consumer markets
  Quadrupling the sample will usually double the accuracy for a given sample design. For example, if we interviewed 500 people, the error on a question would be plus or minus 2.7%, but if we interview 2000, then it will be + or - 1.3%
  They must always be judged in terms of their accuracy on the number in the group of people being examined, a minimum size for a sub-cell in a quantitative survey is around 50 ppl.
- If the ranges of error do not overlap between two results of two sub-groups, then we can say the difference is statistically significant, that sub-group 1 is significantly different with sub-group2 with regards a question
- Quota samples
  Remember to check quality/reputation of online panels.
  Previous survey and census data tell us the splits by gender, age, income, geography, and many other key selection criteria.
  Filling the quota will provide a mix of respondents that is reflective of the population being targeted.
  If numbers required within a subgroup is sufficient to meet the needs of the total sample size but too small to provide reliable results about a subgroup, the common solution is to over sample the subgroup
*Need to know more about factor analysis and clustering


### Chapter 11 Questionnaire design
- Behavior questions
  Aiming at find out what do ppl claim to do.
  They are often more robust and believable than answers to attitudinal questions.
  Behavioural economics: decisions are not necessarily made on logic alone but on heuristics.
- Attitudinal questions
  Scales are commonly used to measure attitudes:
    Numerical rating
    Verbal rating (Questions like how likely can not necessarily be trusted, ppl’s claim in market research is very different from a real buying situation
    Semantic differential scales (Usually used to find out ppl’s emotional attachments to brands)
    Ranking (6 factors in the list is about the maximum, usually would ask about top5)
- Classification questions
  Demographic, socioeconomic, etc. For specific market, they might have a universal socioeconomic grades to use, for example in the UK
- Three steps in questionnaire design
  Formulating the questions: have objectives, is it for brand positioning, satisfaction or more? Listing some points, include classification questions that will be useful for slicing and dicing the data. A reasonable maximum of questionnaire takes about 15-20 minutes with 30-40 questions
    Ensure questions are without bias
    Make the questions simple
    Make the questions very specific (No very often, quite often, every now and then, things like this that’s impossible to identify)
    Avoid jargon
    Avoid questions with a negative in them
    Do not ask questions that are outside of reference of the respondents (Better to ask how many litres of milk do you buy in a typical week instead of how much do you buy each year)
    Avoid too many rating scales
  Arranging layout
    Use screener questions to include only relevant ppl
    Open questions are usually put before closed ones, but the reasoning one often come after closed ones
  Piloting and testing the draft questionnaire
- Special questionnaires: Conjoint analysis/Concept test
    We group product attributes in different ways and see how respondents would pick.
    Need at least 100, and best if can reach more than 200
    Choiced based
    MaxDiff, several rounds of asking for which is the most important to least important factors 
- Trade off grids (need to know more)  
  Easier than Conjoint analysis
  SIMALTO


### Chapter 17 Using market research to segment markets
-Type of segmentation approach
  Geo-demographic: Framework/scheme to describe populations, e.g. PRIZM, Acorn
  Behavioural
  Attitudinal and needs-based segmentation: Attitude - strong, but very few segmentations are based upon them alone, as they are tricky to measure, usually we use likert scales. Needs are usually measured through ranking or a constant-sum scale or points spend question.
  Business
  Hybrid: for example, segmentation based upon segmentation adopted by US low-cost airline which combines flying behaviour with the key needs of different groups of passengers
- Quantitative
  Typical segmentation surveys have relatively large sample sizes
  It is often shaped by prior qualitative research, which helps to include segmentation bases (attitude, needs and behaviours) and include descriptive variables 
    Preferences regarding media/promotional channels
    Where products and services are purchased
    Which providers they are likely to consider
    Positioning/opinion of the client organization
- Statistical methods used in segmentation research
  Factor analysis (more of an input into cluster analysis)
  Cluster analysis (seeks to uncover natural groups or similar patterns of response across a range of input variables (K-means clustering, 2-step clustering, latent class clustering, hierarchical clustering, cluster ensemble analysis)
- Successful segmentations
  Segment distinctiveness
  Segment recognition
  Segment durability
  Segment size: should be less than 6
  Actionable segments
- Communications
  Most successful segmentations are the ones with clear marketing or sales objectives
  Deliverable: a single slide segment description that might be included in a research report/ a customer value proposition (CVP) for each segment.

### Chapter 18 Using Market Research to improve brand position
- Researching at the birth of a brand
  Interviews with internal stakeholders
  Ambitions for the brand
  Intended target audience, how it should make them think and feel. What’s the promise to the market
  The architecture of brands
  Visual identity of the brand
  Qualitative research with the intended target audience
  Desk researching the corporate positioning of major or potential competitors
- Researching new visual identities
  Paired-comparison
  Monadic testing (each respondent is asked for his or her opinions on just 1, randomly chosen design option during the survey. It’s considered to be the fairest means of testing brand visuals, however, the downside is that it would require a larger sample sizes and is thus more expensive)
  Proto-monadic
  Sequential monadic testing
  Criteria:
  Overall likeability
  Extent to which the visual identity aligns with desired brand values
  Whether the logo is associated with the brand/category
  How the logo is perceived in context
- Brand Health monitoring
  Brand tracking survey to understand the performance of the brand in the funnel 
  Awareness
  Spontaneous awareness: naming, top of mind, all of the brands they associate with a category of products [Free text and then coded] → A very good judge of the success of a brand because it relates to how synonymous a brand has become with its category.
  Prompted awareness: excluded the spontaneous mentions from the list.
  Prompted and spontaneous awareness are then added together to produce a metric - Total awareness
  Familiarity (asking those who are aware)
  Consideration (asking those who are aware)
  Usage (with time frame)
  Advocacy (asked of those that use)
  Satisfaction questions, likelihood to recommend
  Other topics covered in brand tracking studies
    Ad awareness (Respondent not aware of the sponsor)
    Channel of purchase (Give important intelligence about the channel strategies of competitors)
    Behavior during the purchase decision
    Switching patterns
    Audience profiling
- Research design
  Frequency: Should be based upon when promo activities are anticipated to fall.
  Consistency: Remain same or very similar
  Do not disclose sponsor or hide until the end of the survey
  Randomize the brand answer lists
  Sample size
  Sample should be designed so that previous survey participants are excluded
  Brand positioning
  Rank the Top 3 or 5 brand positions that are most important to them when making a purchase decision
  Then, participants are asked to state, from the brands of which they are aware, those that they associate with each of the positions
  Remember to include None in the table - help us to detect non taken positions in the market
  Then we can have a matrix of importance and association with our brand
  Brand map: Use correspondence analysis to evaluate the relative extent to which brands are linked with attributes, remember to exclude the effect of brand awareness
- Valuing brands/brand equity
  Brand - Price Trade Off (help measure market value when the financial data is not open or reliable)
  Conjoint survey where different combination of brands and prices (for products that are ostensibly the same, an exercise that include attributes other than price should be considered) are combined, the most valuable brand is the one that is selected even when it’s presented at a higher price than its competitors/the brand has a stronger influence in the purchase decision
